In this Data Science repository, I have done projects upon web scraping, web scraping using selector gadget, data visualisation, simple linear regression and multi- linear regression. Let me explain what dataset is used and what I have done for each project.

In the Web Scraping project, I did IMDB website scraping to scrap the ratings of top 100 most popular movies and stored it in the My_movies.csv file.

In the Web Scraping using selector gadget, I did web scraping of Amazon website of a particular product. In this I scraped the mobile ratings and reviews of Samsung S20 5G phone from Amazon website and saved in Amazon_reviews.csv file. This data can be used by the product's company in this case Samsung to see how much people have liked the particular phone S20 model and what is lacking in their model so as to come up with better model next time.

In the Data Visualisation project, I visualised the data for two data the dataset Runs_Data and Placement_Data. With Runs_Data I plotted bar graph between the number of matches played and runs made. With the placement dataset I first visualised how many students got placed and not placed then I visualised students placed with various other factors like gender, age, salary and their degree and the whole placement status with respect to the above factors using bar graph, line graph, plot graph, pie chart, etc.

In the Simple Linear Regression, I took a data set of LungCapData and sliced it in two columns age and Lung Capacity and combine both into one data frame. Next I split the data set into test set and training set then applied regression on both dataset and visualised the results between the age and lung capcity.

In the Multi Linear Regression, I took a small data of mouse dataset containing size, weight and tail length of various mice. I first visualised the data using simple linear regresssion for size and weight and then took tail length data additionally, and performed multi linear regression and visualized it. In the end I found out one more data column can bring singnificant difference in the distribution curve (visualisation) of the data set when compared for simple and multi linear regression.
